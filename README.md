- Carbon Intensity Line Chart  
  Carbon intensity is a measure of how clean our electricity is. It refers to how many grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) are released to produce a kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity. This line chart is prediction of carbon intensity in the next 48 hours which is drew by using carbon intensity API imported forecast values. Red area means high intensity, yellow area means moderate intensity, green area means low intensity. Users can plug in applicances in green and yellow time period and plug off high-power appliances in red area.
